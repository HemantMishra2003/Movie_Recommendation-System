##                   Movie Recommendation System
          
 
Developed a movie recommendation system using Bag of Words vectorization (CountVectorizer) 
combined with cosine similarity to suggest movies similar to the userâ€™s choice.

Implemented preprocessing and vectorization techniques 
to convert movie overviews into feature vectors for similarity computation.

The system enhances user engagement by recommending 
relevant movies based on content similarity.
